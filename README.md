This is a repo for quick initializing a new Ubuntu installation with some basic tools and configurations. 

The script is written in bash and is intended to be run on a fresh installation of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS/Ubuntu 22.04LTS. 

It will install some basic tools and configure some settings to make the system more usable out of the box.

Choose the `version` of Ubuntu you are running and checkout the corresponding `branch` to get the correct script for your system.
